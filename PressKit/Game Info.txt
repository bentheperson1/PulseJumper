Pulse Jumper is a precision platformer developed and published by Fifth Edge Studios. It's available for download on Steam and Gamejolt for 5$ along with a free demo.

The story is as follows:

You are testing out an experimental military jumping device, until you get off course and end up on an drone AI training course! ...or are you?

Pulse Jumper is designed to be sped-run from the ground up. There is a built in speed run timer to make recording times as easy as possible.
